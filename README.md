# Interactive-Art
###### Connect this code with Makey-Makey and Makey-Makey to conductive materials of your choice to see the interaction.

Abstract art is art that does not attempt to represent an accurate depiction of a visual reality but instead uses shapes, colors, forms and gestural marks to achieve its effect. Everyone has their own interpretation for abstract art. So we decided to use e-textile to make the abstract art interactive for children. Working with Scratch and Makey-Makey would help children get hands on with coding and hardware. This is helping them to learn while have fun with the project.

We make a delicate fabric pattern with different colors and shapes and connect each part to Makey-Makey  using conductive materials which can translate it into a different sound. Children can interact with the pillow by tapping on different patterns and make beautiful music or record a narration of the feelings they get from the piece. They can record whatever representation of the art they have in mind, which teaches them creative expression.
